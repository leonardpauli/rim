				autofix clear + when cursor is moved away
					ability to overide which rules this is done for // add/remove
					eg. spacings
					...
			- on save 
		strictness: strict/loose
	case:
		- clear 
		- ambiguous
			case to select
				- unambiguous with user lint settings
					autofix through change of sourcecode
					add note that it was fixed
						option to add lint option comment (ignore or alt rule)
				- strict: force user to choose
					though change of sourcecode // syntax
					give autofix options
					option to add to lint config
						unintrusive smart: if many similar + majority conform, etc
				- loose: choose one, go on, + add warning
					(ability to add ambiguous-syntax-max-warnings-ok )
			auto debugging
				of output cases, eg. "or did you expect this output instead (because of this (autocorrected) ambiguous case?
